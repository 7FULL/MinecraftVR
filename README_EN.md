The migration of the Minecraft project that was already done: https://github.com/7FULL/MineClone to VR.
Project duration: 2 months for the original project, and 1 month for the VR migration.

What was added to the VR version:
- Migration to VR headsets (obviously xD)
- Compatibility with headsets from different brands
- Hand tracking, as well as its visualization before loading the game
- Interface changes to adapt to VR, including placement on the arm for easier access
- Added arm models to resemble Steve (the character from the game)
- Changes to the character controller to adapt to VR headsets
- Remapping of all controls for use with headset controllers instead of the keyboard
- Possibility to rotate the camera with the right controller, eliminating the need to constantly turn your head
- ... And probably some more things that I'm forgetting, hahaha!

Features included in the game:
- Procedural generation
- Seed system (around 40 million)
- Sound system
- Player system
- Inventory system
- Crafting system
- Recipe system adapted to be done with scriptableObjects from the editor
- Block breaking and placing
- Entity spawning system (works similar to the original Minecraft)
- AI for passive mobs
- AI for aggressive mobs
- Particles
- Optimization (chunks, face cooling, border cooling ...)
- Food system
- Health system
- Entity cap
- TNT (BOOOOM!!!)
- Item dropping system (for both entities and blocks)
- Biomes (currently there are 5, but the system is designed to support as many as desired)
- Layers system (forests, patches of gravel on the map... Fully customizable and scalable)
- Player UI very similar to the original
- ... And probably some more things that I'm forgetting, hahaha!
